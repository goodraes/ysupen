　　后来，不知道怎么，我娘的精神就有点恍惚起来了，没人的时候自哭自笑，经常半夜里不睡觉，眼睛睁得亮闪闪的，古怪地“嘿嘿嘿”，我的汗毛一根根全竖起来。我爹就也不睡了，眼睁睁守着她，坐以待旦。白天我娘情形好些，有时糊涂，有时清醒。清醒的时候也做饭也绣花，糊涂劲上来就到处乱串，随地乱躺，身上全是泥，头发上沾满草棍。我爹寸步不离地跟着她，拉她回家，她就把我爹抓得鲜血淋漓，有一次甚至抠下一块肉来。千哄万哄哄回来，安顿好，让我看着，我爹就从炕席底下摸出金贵的五毛钱，跑到集上给她买一碗饸饹端回来，要不就用一张老荷叶托几个小水煎包子来。饸饹上飘着油星，包子煎得焦黄油亮，喷香！我娘一口一口吃，我爹就坐一边抽烟，看着她，喉结一下一下动。我娘有个毛病，就是爱剩饭，多好的东西剩下一口就不吃了，我叫我爹：“爹，你吃了吧。”他不肯，让我吃，我也不肯。他就硬逼我娘张开嘴，给她强喂下去。我爹力气大，强壮得象头牛，不过除了这种时候，真没见他对我娘用过蛮力。

My dad also don't sleep, only keep her ZuoYiDaiDan.
My niang situation better during the day, sometimes confused, sometimes awake.
Awake also cooking also embroidery, confused strength begin to wander freely, lying anywhere, is covered with mud, hair covered with grass on a stick.
All my father followed her, her home, she took my dad to catch blood dripping wet, once even to dig down a piece of meat.
Thousand coax coax coax back, settle down, let me look, my dad is pulled out from under the kang mat well five hair moneys, ran to the set to buy her a bowl of one Ge back end, or with a few small water package to a lotus leaf.
